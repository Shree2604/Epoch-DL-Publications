Maintain the following structure while contributing to projects under this repository:

```
📁 /EpochIIITS-Publications
   └── 📁 Brain-Computer Interface
       ├── 📁 Article_Name
       │   ├── code_files/
       │   ├── models/
       │   ├── README.md
       │   └── dataset/
       ├── 📁 Article_Name
       │   ├── code_files/
       │   ├── models/
       │   |── README.md
       │   └── dataset/
       └── ...
```

Ensure that any contributions follow this directory structure. Each article should have its own folder under "Deep Learning," containing relevant code files (`code_files/`), a README.md file explaining the code, and any necessary datasets (`dataset/`).
